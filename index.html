                                    As a member of the Data Science team at FourthWall media I successfully utilized my experience in Python
                                    with Numpy and Pandas to perform advanced analysis and regression model creation
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Used Numpy and Pandas to analyze irregularities in timeseries data before and after a source data format 
                                    conversion. Found the source of the irregularities and discovered novel patterns in timeseries densitites

                                <p>
                                    Created a regression model in R to predict the average daily viewership of a random sample of TV viewers.
                                    Successfully implemented all parts of the Data Science pipeline includeing obtaining data from an Oracle SQL
                                    database, cleaning the data of bad entries, visualizing trends in TV shows users typically watch, and 
                                    modelling the data using regression. Presented my findings to the rest of the Data Science team.

                                        In 2019 I participated in AWS Deepracer, an autonomous online racing compitition utilizing reinforcement 
                                        learning to train models that complete to race around a virtual track. Contestants would create their own reward
                                        function and adjust the training parameters before training and submitting their model to the contest. 
                                        Placed in the top 20% out of thousands of submissions.

                                        Expanding upon what I learned during by Computer Vision class in college I used the Bag of Visual Words 
                                        technique to try to predict whether the subject of an image was of dolphin, airplane, or leopard. The 
                                        project is written in Python and utilizes the NumPy library for matrix operation, CV2 for keypoint 
                                        identification, and Scikit-learn for KMeans and SVM training. After training the model could successfully 
                                        identify the subject of an image 82% of the time
